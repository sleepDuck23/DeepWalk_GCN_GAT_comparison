# DeepWalk_GCN_GAT_comparison
Final project for the MVA's master course "Graphical Models: Discrete Inference and Learning"

Project designed to code from scratch the models: DeepWalk, Graphical convolutional network and Graphical attention network.
Test the influence of parameters on the models (focus on the DeepWalk).
Evaluate models using F1-macro score as metric.
Test all methos on the node classification task.
Datasets: Cora and Chameleon
The project was designed to run on kaggle, so it considers that the datasets are already imported.
